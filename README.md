#MapReduce - Paul-Adrien CORDONNIER

This is the mapReduce wordCount example for the HADOOP course.

Written in Python, a language I'm absolutely not familiar with. Sorry if I did something wrong but it seems it work \o/

##How do I make this awesome program work ??

You just need to provide a text file as an argument, like this
```bash
python mapreduce.py text.txt
```

The output is written to stdout.
